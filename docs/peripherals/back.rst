Back Matter
===========

``<book @code="BAK" style="id">``

The BAK book and its divisions can be used for storing material which is typically presented at the end of a scripture publication. In practice some back matter content is large enough to require storing it in its own book file (Concordance, Glossary, Topical Index, Names Index).

-----

The following back matter content should each be created within their own book file.
